# Spotify-Lookalike

This was HTML & CSS Practice.
I was following a youtube tutorial from the channel Nit Net to create a spotify lookalike starting page.
it was a brief but illuminating tutorial, answering some of my questions. For example:

    *How to properly use font awesome icons
    *How to refer to the font awesome icons in the css file without having to 
     host the font awesome icons folder onto my personal pc
    *How to use google fonts
    *Linear gradients in CSS 
    
   The resultant page looks as follows:
   
   ![My Image](Images/original-page.png)
   

# Edits to be made
I have an intention to change some aspects to make the page more to my liking. I will upload those slight changes in a few hours.
Also, Font Awesome seems to be disagreeing with the code, and not displaying the icons. I have to ensure they are up to date.
